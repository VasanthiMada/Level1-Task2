# 🌸 IRIS Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Level 1 - Task 2 | Intern Orbit Internship

This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into one of the three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** — based on their **sepal** and **petal** measurements.

---

## 🔍 Prompt

Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Utilize the **Iris dataset** to train a classification model that can effectively learn from the given measurements and predict the correct species for new, unseen Iris flowers.

---
